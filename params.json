{"body":"Norman keyboard layout\r\n======================\r\n\r\nNorman is a fully optimized alternative keyboard layout to [QWERTY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY). It maintains keyboard shortcuts for the letters QWASZXCV and keeps 22/26 letters in the normal use pattern of their QWERTY finger, if not the original QWERTY location.\r\n\r\n# Setting the framework\r\n\r\n## My world - Fact\r\n\r\n * I am **right handed**. My right hand generally does everything better and faster than my left.\r\n * My **pinkies are slow**. On a keyboard, I don't press with my pinky finger independently so much as I hold it stiff and press my entire hand in the direction of my pinky. My right pinky is so slow, I use my right ring finger for the delete key.\r\n * I type a lot and to a large degree, **my career and family depend on my hands and fingers** working optimally.\r\n * Live and grew up in the USA. I don't really care about other countries.\r\n * When I have tried learning alternative keyboard layouts, I find myself using the same finger on the wrong hand (i.e. typing E with my left middle finger in the Workman layout).\r\n * I think when users are considering alternative keyboard layouts, they've **already become proficient with QWERTY**. There are deep brain connections after several years of QWERTY typing. Learning a new keyboard **layout that shifts keys to different fingers or to the opposite hand as QWERTY compounds the learning curve and increases the chances for conversion failure**.\r\n * Learning a new keyboard layout is slow, painful, and frustrating. Having tried Dvorak, Colemak, and Workman with what I consider a serious effort, none have made me feel like I should make the full-time conversion.\r\n\r\n## The rest of the world - Fact\r\n\r\n * **We live in a QWERTY world**, at least for the US keyboard.\r\n * Software developers use common shortcuts, which are universal across applications and operating systems. **Undo, copy, cut, paste, select all, and quit** should be one of the first things a person uses when using a computer. In fact, they're so important, that just about sums up the only shortcuts to have their own implementations in mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. Because of their commonality and frequency of use, **the shortcuts for those operations are already in optimal locations** in QWERTY.\r\n * QWERTY is not an optimal keyboard layout for typing efficiency.\r\n * **Grid layouts** like [TypeMatrix](http://typematrix.com/) is **not likely to be adopted** widely by computer manufacturers. **TypeMatrix is as expensive as some fully-functional tablet computers**.\r\n * Contoured keyboards like the [Kinesis](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm) are even less likely to be adopted widely.\r\n * Keyboards with **cords are dinosaurs**.\r\n * **Wireless keyboards** like the [FrogPad](http://www.frogpad.com/) with multiple parts **still require significant effort** to learn new typing formats.\r\n * **Undo/copy/cut/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts**, which belong on the left hand and **are already in optimal locations**.\r\n\r\n## Defining \"fully optimized\"\r\n\r\nEach keyboard layout claims it is the best because they each use a different metric. [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) gained a boost in fame when it was declared to be the best in the [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) study. [Workman](http://www.workmanlayout.com/) claimed to improve on Colemak because it modified the key cap scores used in the Carpalx study by adding a subjective gauge of *lateral movement and finger curling preferences* to the cap scores. [David Piepgrass likened](http://qism.blogspot.com/2006/11/asset-vs-colemak.html) the [Asset](http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/) layout to Colemak, but by declaring Asset to be closer to QWERTY, said it would be better than Colemak. It's also interesting to note that Colemak also advertises similarity to QWERTY.\r\n\r\n### Norman vs. \"the others\"\r\n\r\nEvery layout has its strengths. The author of Workman is confident in his key cap scoring model, which if applied to U.S. English yields remarkably low effort scores, however the full optimization of Workman compromises the locations for copy/paste, putting them in less efficient locations for frequent copy operations. Accepting Workman as \"fully optimized\" means agreeing with the scores used in the Workman design.\r\n\r\nColemak and Asset are similar layouts, but in the design of Asset, the same-finger assignment from QWERTY is raised as a higher concern in the design. Though Colemak is touted for its supposed ease of switching from QWERTY, **Asset keeps 20/26 letters on the same finger**, whereas **Colemak only keeps 15/26**. As the Carpalx study shows, the theoretical loss of efficiency by keeping the QWERTY same-finger design is fractional, perhaps inconsequential.\r\n\r\nThe drastic movement of keys in the [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard) layout is the main reason [Colemak's FAQ](http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What.27s_wrong_with_the_Dvorak_layout.3F) cites for Dvorak adoption failure. Efforts to achieve \"full optimization\" by moving keys all around the keyboard like in [QGMLWY](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization), away from their originating QWERTY hand and finger, are also destined to increase the likelihood of adoption failure.\r\n\r\n**When switching from QWERTY**, as a user who types enough to be concerned enough to switch, the loss of productivity in typing speed and in gained frustration is cause to **minimize not only the general movement of key caps, but the finite movement to a different hand or finger on the same hand**. Maintaining common shortcuts is essential to adoption. The better job you can do at **minimizing frustration and productivity loss**, the more likely **a conversion away from QWERTY will be successful**.\r\n\r\nThe importance of common shortcuts and historic link to QWERTY is evident when comparing the overall success of adoption between [Arensito](http://www.pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard), introduced 2001, and Colemak, introduced 2006. Arensito has essentially no resemblance to QWERTY. Colemak has been adopted in the main keyboard options during operating system installs for Apple, Linux, Chromium OS, NetBSD, and FreeBSD. It also has add-on options for just about any other operating system. Arensito is available as an add-on for Windows only.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to improve on any of the available layout alternatives to QWERTY, all the authors of Asset, Colemak, Workman, Arensito, Dvorak, Capewell-Dvorak, Klausler, and Carpalx variants should be considered as they each have slightly different goals and research findings.\r\n\r\nI tried for existing layouts after researching them as possible candidates. Here are some of my findings from studying, and trying some of the aforementioned:\r\n\r\n#### Asset\r\n\r\n * Asset is so great that six years later, **its creator doesn't even use it**.\r\n * I think its emphasis on QWERTY similarity has validity based on my experience trying to train to a key shifted to a different finger on the opposite hand.\r\n * When I started designing my own keyboard layout, I independently started with the same 8 keys on the home row as are used with Asset.\r\n\r\n#### Colemak\r\n\r\n * Colemak gained popularity to a large degree by advertising **similarity to QWERTY**.\r\n * The community around Colemak has been very successful in getting it added in feature positions for popular operating systems.\r\n * As OJ Bucao observed when designing Workman, the Colemak layout has a **high degree of lateral finger movement** to the center column for D and H. I believe **the center column should be de-prioritized and not considered part of the \"home row.\"**\r\n\r\n#### Workman\r\n\r\n * OJ Bucao is a big fan of the TypeMatrix keyboard, a non-standard, grid style keyboard. When launching www.workmanlayout.com, he even created the feature layout image using the grid instead of a standard staggered design. This likely impacted the design of the staggered scores. The \r\n * Workman's model is designed around a score for each key cap.\r\n * The scoring model treats the left hand as equal to the right.\r\n * The keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste are shifted to the right unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n#### Dvorak\r\n\r\n * Dvorak is a huge break away from QWERTY. There is a high degree of frustration and a long period of productivity loss in converting to it.\r\n * Common shortcut keys are shifted around the keyboard and therefore should disqualify it from consideration by anyone if for no other reason, Colemak's wide availability.","name":"Norman","google":"UA-19336115-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
