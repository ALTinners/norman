The included keyboard layouts are packaged as keylayout bundles, including an alternate icon similar in style to the system icons for other built-in layouts like Dvorak or Colemak.

Asset, Minimak variants, Norman, Qwpr, and Workman variants will be added as an Input Source option to Language & Text in System Preferences. U.S., U.S. Extended, Dvorak, and Colemak are already built-in to recent versions of Mac OSX.

Norman is based on the US keyboard layout with the same dead keys moved to different locations.

To uninstall a layout, remove the relevant bundle in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/.

Ukelele was used to create the layout:
