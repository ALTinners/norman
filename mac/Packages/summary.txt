Open System Preferences, click on the Language & Text icon, and in the Input Menu tab enable the Norman layout.

Make sure that the "Show input menu in menu bar" box is also checked.

To switch quickly between layouts you can press Command+Space or Command+Option+Space. Note, this hotkey combination conflicts with the default settings for showing Spotlight. Check your settings in System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts tab, Spotlight against Keyboard & Text Input.

Optionally, activate "Show Input menu in login window" through the Login Options on the Users & Groups system preference pane.
