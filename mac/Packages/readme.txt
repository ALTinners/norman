Norman keyboard layout is packaged as a keylayout bundle, including an alternate icon similar in style to the system icons for other built-in layouts like Dvorak or Colemak.

Norman will be added as an Input Source option to Language & Text in System Preferences.

Norman is based on the US keyboard layout with the same dead keys moved to different locations.

To uninstall the layout, remove the Norman bundle from /Library/Keyboard Layouts/.

Ukelele was used to create the layout:
