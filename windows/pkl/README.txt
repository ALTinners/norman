Norman-PKL
=========

Norman-PKL implements Norman keyboard layouts for the Portable Keyboard Layout program. Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) is an open source software program that allows you to use different keyboard layouts in Windows without having to install them. It can be run directly from a USB flash drive or any other portable medium.

Norman-PKL has been tested to work with PKL version 0.3.

In order to add the Norman layout to your PKL installation extract the “norman” folder from this archive into "Portable Keyboard Layout\layouts" and specify the layout you wish to use in "pkl.ini".
