Type Fu hack for Norman layout
==============================

Jarek Foksa, the author of Type Fu, is comfortable with the layouts currently available in Type Fu from the Mac App Store or http://type-fu.com/.

He plans on adding a layout configuration tool in the next major version. Until he does, an existing layout has to be overwritten to introduce an alternate layout.

This distribution includes Norman layout files to replace the QWERTY files included in Type Fu. To replace the QWERTY layout, right click on the Type Fu app in your Applications directory and select `Show Package Contents`. Navigate to the same directories as are included with the Norman Type Fu layout files and replace the Type Fu version with the Norman files.

When running Type Fu, keep Qwerty as the Keyboard layout selection in the Options menu. Note the Type Fu virtual keyboard will show the Norman layout.
